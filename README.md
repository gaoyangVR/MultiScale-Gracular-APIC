# MultiScale-Gracular-APIC

This is the source code of paper <Simulating Multi-scale, Granular Materials and Their Transitions with a Hybrid Euler-Lagrange Solver>.
The program is based on C/C++ and CUDA C.
Please decompress <Multiphase. rar> file into your current download directory, the program can run correctly.
Operating environment:
Windows 10;
Visual Studio 2019;
Cuda 11.1.
I have included all the other external libraries or header files need already, so no additional configuration is required.
